    <p> The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a young nation with a rich and fascinating history. Formed in 1971, the UAE is a federation of seven emirates: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Fujairah, and Ras Al Khaimah. Before unification, the region was known for its tribal communities, pearl diving, and trade routes that connected it to Europe, Asia, and Africa. <br>
      Under the visionary leadership of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the UAE rapidly transformed into a modern and prosperous country. Abu Dhabi became the capital, while Dubai emerged as a global hub for business and tourism. Despite its rapid modernization, the UAE remains deeply connected to its cultural heritage, with a strong emphasis on tradition, hospitality, and the preservation of its natural environment. <br>
      Today, the UAE stands as one of the most dynamic and forward-thinking countries in the Middle East, blending its ancient past with cutting-edge innovation and development. </p>
